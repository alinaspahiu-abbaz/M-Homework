    Students Portfolio Repo
    You should have already had created a Student Portfolio Repo for both Frontend and Backend.
    Your app will be improved by connecting it to a local MongoDB storage and enabling creation, read, update and deleting in a real database.
    //BACKEND
    Your previously developed backend should have the following routes included:
    GET /students => returns the list of students
    GET /students/:id => returns a single student
    POST /students => create a new student
    PUT /students/:id => edit the student with the given id
    DELETE /students/:id => delete the student with the given id
    [EXTRA] POST /checkEmail => check if another student has the same email. The parameter should be passed in the body
    It should not be possible to add a new student if another has the same email.
    GET /projects => returns the list of projects
    GET /projects/:id => returns a single project
    POST /projects => create a new project
    PUT /projects/:id => edit the project with the given id
    DELETE /projects/:id => delete the project with the given id
    [EXTRA] GET /students/:studentID/projects/ => get all the project for a student with a given studentID
    [EXTRA] GET /projects?name=searchQuery => filter the projects and extracts the only that match the condition (es.: Name contains searchQuery)
    We need to add MongoDB to the whole project. Mongo's data design can follow different approaches and therefore your API could look different. 
    We could have different alternatives to design our data, like embed projects into users or create two separates collections.
    You have to refactor previous APIs, in order to match your design choice
    //FRONTEND
    You should have the following features in your frontend:
    - Add a new Student ([EXTRA]use CheckEmail before sending the post to the backend)
    - Show Students on a list, with query by Country
    - Every Student could be edited or deleted
    - New Project creation / deletion / update / list
    - Show projects in students detail using the /students/:id API
