    Solo Challenge: Market Place / Amazon Like + MongoDB
    Upgrade your previously created API using a MongoDB Database.
    //---------------------------------------------------------
    START FROM PREVIOUS VERSION OF AMAZON / MARKETPLACE API!
    //---------------------------------------------------------
    Every product in your marketplace has this information:
    {
        "name": "app test 1",  //REQUIRED
        "description": "somthing longer", //REQUIRED
        "brand": "nokia", //REQUIRED
        "imageUrl": "https://drop.ndtv.com/TECH/product_database/images/2152017124957PM_635_nokia_3310.jpeg?downsize=*:420&output-quality=80", //REQUIRED
        "price": 100, //REQUIRED
        "category": "smartphones"
        "createdAt": "2019-07-19T09:32:10.535Z", //SERVER GENERATED (take a look at Mongoose docs to get how this can be automatically generated)
        "updatedAt": "2019-07-19T09:32:10.535Z", //SERVER GENERATED
    }
    And the reviews looks like:
     {
        "comment": "A good book but definitely I don't like many parts of the plot", //REQUIRED
        "rate": 3, //REQUIRED, max 5
        "createdAt": "2019-08-01T12:46:45.895Z" // SERVER GENERATED
    },
    //DATABASE
    Create the necessary collections. Is up to you to choose how many collections are needed to handle Products, Reviews, Shopping Cart[EXTRA]
    //BACKEND
    You are in charge of building the Backend using NodeJS + Express + Mongoose.
    You are going to study how is the better choice of design for the APIs for handling CRUD for products and reviews
    Extra method for product's image upload (POST /products/{id}/upload)
    Add the possibility to filter Products and paginate Products
    [EXTRA] Create the required endpoints for Shopping cart
    //NOTE:
    for GET methods, add PAGINATION in order to get X elements at a time
    //FRONTEND
    Create some filters (like checkboxes, toggles, switches, ...) to obtain a filtered list of Products from the db. Add backend pagination
    Check from the frontend if everything is still working ;)
