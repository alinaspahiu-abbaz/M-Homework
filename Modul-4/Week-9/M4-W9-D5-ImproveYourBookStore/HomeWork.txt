        API INFO:
​
        You have a CRUD endpoint for comments on:
​
        https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/comments/
​
        This means you can GET, DELETE, POST, PUT data from there.
​
        The Comment structure is this:
​
        {
          "comment": "A good book but definitely I don't like many parts of the plot",
          "rate": 3,
          "elementId": "0316438960"
        }
​
        Where:
        - comment is the comment inserted by the user
        - rate is a value between 1 and 5
        - elementId is the ASIN of the book
        - use usual Authentication
​
        !IMPORTANT!
        Yuo can't get ALL the comments. You have to specify the ElementID / ASIN in the query:
​
        https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/comments/{ASIN}
​
        Doing so, you'll get all the comments for a specific book
