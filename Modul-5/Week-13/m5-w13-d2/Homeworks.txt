/*
    Upgrade Strive Books API!
    You are in charge of including new features in the Strive Books API.
    You can start from the version we built this morning.
    A comment could be posted by a user to whatever project he likes.
    A comment is defined by:
    - CommentID //Server Generated
    - BookID //ASIN
    - UserName
    - Text
    - Date //Server Generated
    //BACKEND
    Add the following features:
    POST /books/id/comments => adds a comment for book {id}
    GET /books/id/comments => gets all the comments for book {id}
    DELETE /books/comments/id2 => delete comment {id2}
    //FRONTEND
    You need now to connect your previously created React App for Strive books.
    Modify the previous application in order to use your own API.
    //CLOUD
    Deploy everything on 2 instances on HEROKU (one for client, one for server)
    If you have troubles with running be on heroku just add "start": "node ./src/server.js" script to your package.json
    Configure CORS to make them work together.
